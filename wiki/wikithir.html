                    This plugin allows players to experience a more realistic and challenging survival experience. You'll constantly have a thirst bar and it will require you to drink (preferably untainted) water.<br>
                    You're able to check your thirst at any time via <strong>/thirst</strong>. In addition, the plugin will warn you in chat when you're beginning to get dangerously low on thirst. If you run out of thirst, you'll begin to take damage.<br>
                    This plugin <strong>must be enabled</strong> in order to use, at /warp difficulty. Otherwise it doesn't apply to players. It can be disabled at any time.

            If you have both Thirst and Diseases enabled, You must cook water bottles before drinking or you risk contracting cholera. If just thirst is enabled, you can drink from any water source freely.
