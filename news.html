		   The server is now open, it's in a sort of open beta, so keep that in mind while playing, as some things still need to be fixed and added. Some things are intentionally left out until we can get a since of the server's balancing.

		   We're making head way with the update, it's currently set for a release this Saturday. The world will be 8kx8k and custom. I'll hopefully be able to get all necessary things up and working.<br>
		   I'm attempting to get a website-side wiki going, so that we're less limited when it comes to making wiki updates, as well so I just have  more control and the website looks more uniform than previously. Eventually I plan on also adding the forums to this website in some form.

                    I'm currently working toward our "Downgrade update", we're going from 1.13 to 1.12 in order to give our server much more content and allow us to work on plugins that weren't being updated and may not be<br>
                    With this new update, we'll have Skillapi (Our class/Race system), Slimefun, Throwable weapons, as well as a few new plugins such as Jukebox, Movecraft, and a few more (If we can get them working).

                    We are currently preparing to do a downgrade of the server to 1.12.2. This was voted on our Discord in favor, due to the fact that many of our plugins which add a lot of the server's content are currently not working and don't seem to be making good progress. Join our discord to get more up-to-date news.

                    We'll be having an event this upcoming weekend, Saturday 25th around 2pm EST, as per usual. The theme will be around Thanksgiving but not exactly pertaining to it. We'll also be advertising and I'll be hopefully fixing the voting system so that players can actually use the vote chest system I intended.

                    The server is up and running, so feel free to join via the Server IP above. I'm constantly working on things. If you check the website actively, I highly suggest joining our Discord to get news on the server immediantly as its done.

                    The server's currently being reset, I was away on vacation thats why I've only just now started to work on things, be sure to check the discord for more common updates. We'll be going back to our older style of server.
